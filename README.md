# HIA-302-IndProject

The dataset used in this project is titled the horse-colic dataset. The horse-colic dataset describes medical characteristics of horses with colic and whether they lived or died. 

There are 300 rows and 26 input variables with one output variable. It is a binary classification prediction task that involves predicting 1 if the horse lived and 2 if the horse died. 

There are many fields we could select to predict in this dataset.

In this case, we will predict whether the problem was surgical or not (column index 23), making it a binary classification problem. 

The dataset has numerous missing values for many of the columns where each missing value is marked with a question mark character (“?”).

There were a list of tasks that were required such as replacing header titles with the appropriate names and replacing '?' with 'NaN'.

The data cleaning and preparation process was done using Python via Jupyter Notebook and it was linked to this repository via Github Desktop.
